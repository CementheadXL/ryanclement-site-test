        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Bringing data, strategy, and AI to nonprofit fundraising.</p>
    </header>
    <p>Hi, I’m Ryan Clement— founder of Ryan Clement Consulting and Manager of Philanthropic Research at the Cleveland Museum of Art. With a Master’s in Business Psychology and a deep love for both data and mission-driven work, I help nonprofits tap into the power of AI and smart strategy to raise more money and work more efficiently.</p>

  <p>I specialize in uncovering high-potential donors, building predictive models, and streamlining CRM systems, but what I really do is turn complex data into clear, actionable insight. I love partnering with teams who want to modernize their development operations and aren’t afraid to try something new.</p>

  <p>If you're ready to grow smarter and build deeper donor relationships, I’m here to help make that happen.</p>

        <h3>Things I Can Do For You</h3>
        <p>I know from experience—especially working with small and mid-sized shops—that you may be thinking: “We need more donors,” “We have the data but aren’t sure how to use it,” or “We don’t even know what to track.” That’s completely normal. If you’d like to talk through where to start or how to move forward, just scroll down and send me a message — I’m always happy to have an initial conversation, no charge.</p>

    <h3 class="section-heading">Unlocking the Power of Data and Human Connection</h3>
    <p>
      With a background in both front-line nonprofit work and behind-the-scenes data analysis, I understand the unique pressures small and mid-sized organizations face—especially when budgets are tight. I bring a hybrid skill set to help you do more with less: uncovering insights in your data while also strengthening how your team engages donors, constituents, and partners.

        <h4>Rooted in Nonprofit Realities</h4>
        <p>From AmeriCorps to major campaign support, I’ve worked alongside program staff, fundraisers, and community leaders—so I speak your language and understand the day-to-day challenges.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Data-Driven, Human-Centered</h4>
        <p>Whether mapping connections, building research profiles, or segmenting your donor base, I apply analysis with purpose: to deepen relationships and drive results.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Designed for Lean Teams</h4>
        <p>You don’t need a huge CRM team or a six-figure budget to build smart systems. I design sustainable, scalable solutions that fit your reality—and grow with you.</p>
      </div>
	  <div class="card">
  <h4>Translating Insight Into Action</h4>
  <p>From donor behavior to board reports, I turn complex data into clear guidance your team can use—right now. Whether it’s building a strategy or helping frontline staff act with confidence, I connect the dots between numbers and next steps.</p>
